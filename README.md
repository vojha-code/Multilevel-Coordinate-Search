# Global optimization by multilevel coordinate search (MCS)

Global optimization by multilevel coordinate search (MCS). This is a dividing rectangle (i.e., Brach and Bound) like an optimization algorithm. It is similar to the DIRECT algorithm. Originaly the MATLAB code was Developed by Waltraud Huyer and Arnold Neumaier </br>

## RUN
To run this programe execute from the project hierarchy

- msc (root)
- - functions
- - gls
- - mcs_func
- - mcs.py
- - **runmcs.py**

```python:
$ runmcs.py
```

_You may need to adapt path as this program was executed in spyder ide from the root._

## Customized Functions
